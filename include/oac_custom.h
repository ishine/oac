/** @defgroup oac_custom Oac Custom
 * @{
 *  Oac Custom is an optional part of the Oac specification and
 * reference implementation which uses a distinct API from the regular
 * API and supports frame sizes that are not normally supported.\ Use
 * of Oac Custom is discouraged for all but very special applications
 * for which a frame size different from 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 ms is needed
 * (for either complexity or latency reasons) and where interoperability
 * is less important.
 *
 * In addition to the interoperability limitations the use of Oac custom
 * disables a substantial chunk of the codec and generally lowers the
 * quality available at a given bitrate. Normally when an application needs
 * a different frame size from the codec it should buffer to match the
 * sizes but this adds a small amount of delay which may be important
 * in some very low latency applications. Some transports (especially
 * constant rate RF transports) may also work best with frames of
 * particular durations.
 *
 * Liboac only supports custom modes if they are enabled at compile time.
 *
 * The Oac Custom API is similar to the regular API but the
 * @ref oac_encoder_create and @ref oac_decoder_create calls take
 * an additional mode parameter which is a structure produced by
 * a call to @ref oac_custom_mode_create. Both the encoder and decoder
 * must create a mode using the same sample rate (fs) and frame size
 * (frame size) so these parameters must either be signaled out of band
 * or fixed in a particular implementation.
 *
 * Similar to regular Oac the custom modes support on the fly frame size
 * switching, but the sizes available depend on the particular frame size in
 * use. For some initial frame sizes on a single on the fly size is available.

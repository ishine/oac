 * @mainpage Oac
 *
 * The Oac codec is designed for interactive speech and audio transmission over the Internet.
 * It is designed by the IETF Codec Working Group and incorporates technology from
 * Skype's SILK codec and Xiph.Org's CELT codec.
 *
 * The Oac codec is designed to handle a wide range of interactive audio applications,
 * including Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game chat, and even remote live music
 * performances. It can scale from low bit-rate narrowband speech to very high quality
 * stereo music. Its main features are:

 * @li Sampling rates from 8 to 48 kHz
 * @li Bit-rates from 6 kb/s to 510 kb/s
 * @li Support for both constant bit-rate (CBR) and variable bit-rate (VBR)
 * @li Audio bandwidth from narrowband to full-band
 * @li Support for speech and music
 * @li Support for mono and stereo
 * @li Support for multichannel (up to 255 channels)
 * @li Frame sizes from 2.5 ms to 60 ms
 * @li Good loss robustness and packet loss concealment (PLC)
 * @li Floating point and fixed-point implementation
 *
 * Documentation sections:

/** @defgroup oac_encoder Oac Encoder
 * @{
 *
 * @brief This page describes the process and functions used to encode Oac.
 *
 * Since Oac is a stateful codec, the encoding process starts with creating an encoder
 * state. This can be done with:
 *
 * @code
 * int          error;
 * OacEncoder *enc;
 * enc = oac_encoder_create(Fs, channels, application, &error);
 * @endcode
 *
 * From this point, @c enc can be used for encoding an audio stream. An encoder state
 * @b must @b not be used for more than one stream at the same time. Similarly, the encoder
 * state @b must @b not be re-initialized for each frame.
 *
 * While oac_encoder_create() allocates memory for the state, it's also possible
 * to initialize pre-allocated memory:
 *
 * @code
 * int          size;
 * int          error;
 * OacEncoder *enc;
 * size = oac_encoder_get_size(channels);
 * enc = malloc(size);
 * error = oac_encoder_init(enc, Fs, channels, application);
 * @endcode
 *
 * where oac_encoder_get_size() returns the required size for the encoder state. Note that
 * future versions of this code may change the size, so no assumptions should be made about it.
 *
 * The encoder state is always continuous in memory and only a shallow copy is sufficient
 * to copy it (e.g. memcpy())
 *
 * It is possible to change some of the encoder's settings using the oac_encoder_ctl()
 * interface. All these settings already default to the recommended value, so they should
 * only be changed when necessary. The most common settings one may want to change are:
 *
 * @code
 * oac_encoder_ctl(enc, OAC_SET_BITRATE(bitrate));
 * oac_encoder_ctl(enc, OAC_SET_COMPLEXITY(complexity));
 * oac_encoder_ctl(enc, OAC_SET_SIGNAL(signal_type));
 * @endcode
 *
 * where
 *
 * @arg bitrate is in bits per second (b/s)
 * @arg complexity is a value from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest complexity and 10 is the highest
 * @arg signal_type is either OAC_AUTO (default), OAC_SIGNAL_VOICE, or OAC_SIGNAL_MUSIC
 *
 * See @ref oac_encoderctls and @ref oac_genericctls for a complete list of parameters that can be set or queried. Most parameters can be set or changed at any time during a stream.
 *
 * To encode a frame, oac_encode() or oac_encode_float() must be called with exactly one frame (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 or 60 ms) of audio data:
 * @code
 * len = oac_encode(enc, audio_frame, frame_size, packet, max_packet);
 * @endcode
 *
 * where
 * <ul>
 * <li>audio_frame is the audio data in oac_int16 (or float for oac_encode_float())</li>
 * <li>frame_size is the duration of the frame in samples (per channel)</li>
 * <li>packet is the byte array to which the compressed data is written</li>
 * <li>max_packet is the maximum number of bytes that can be written in the packet (4000 bytes is recommended).
 *     Do not use max_packet to control VBR target bitrate, instead use the #OAC_SET_BITRATE CTL.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * oac_encode() and oac_encode_float() return the number of bytes actually written to the packet.
 * The return value <b>can be negative</b>, which indicates that an error has occurred. If the return value
 * is 2 bytes or less, then the packet does not need to be transmitted (DTX).
 *
 * Once the encoder state if no longer needed, it can be destroyed with
 *
 * @code
 * oac_encoder_destroy(enc);
 * @endcode
 *
 * If the encoder was created with oac_encoder_init() rather than oac_encoder_create(),
 * then no action is required aside from potentially freeing the memory that was manually
 * allocated for it (calling free(enc) for the example above)
 *

 *    forward error correction to protect against packet loss. Use this
 *    mode for typical VoIP applications. Because of the enhancement,
 *    even at high bitrates the output may sound different from the input.
 *
 * @ref OAC_APPLICATION_AUDIO gives best quality at a given bitrate for most
 *    non-voice signals like music. Use this mode for music and mixed
 *    (music/voice) content, broadcast, and applications requiring less
 *    than 15 ms of coding delay.
 *

/** @defgroup oac_decoder Oac Decoder
 * @{
 *
 * @brief This page describes the process and functions used to decode Oac.
 *
 * The decoding process also starts with creating a decoder
 * state. This can be done with:
 * @code
 * int          error;
 * OacDecoder *dec;
 * dec = oac_decoder_create(Fs, channels, &error);
 * @endcode
 * where
 * @li Fs is the sampling rate and must be 8000, 12000, 16000, 24000, or 48000
 * @li channels is the number of channels (1 or 2)
 * @li error will hold the error code in case of failure (or #OAC_OK on success)
 * @li the return value is a newly created decoder state to be used for decoding
 *
 * While oac_decoder_create() allocates memory for the state, it's also possible
 * to initialize pre-allocated memory:
 * @code
 * int          size;
 * int          error;
 * OacDecoder *dec;
 * size = oac_decoder_get_size(channels);
 * dec = malloc(size);
 * error = oac_decoder_init(dec, Fs, channels);
 * @endcode
 * where oac_decoder_get_size() returns the required size for the decoder state. Note that
 * future versions of this code may change the size, so no assumptions should be made about it.
 *
 * The decoder state is always continuous in memory and only a shallow copy is sufficient
 * to copy it (e.g. memcpy())
 *
 * To decode a frame, oac_decode() or oac_decode_float() must be called with a packet of compressed audio data:
 * @code
 * frame_size = oac_decode(dec, packet, len, decoded, max_size, 0);
 * @endcode
 * where
 *
 * @li packet is the byte array containing the compressed data
 * @li len is the exact number of bytes contained in the packet
 * @li decoded is the decoded audio data in oac_int16 (or float for oac_decode_float())
 * @li max_size is the max duration of the frame in samples (per channel) that can fit into the decoded_frame array
 *
 * oac_decode() and oac_decode_float() return the number of samples (per channel) decoded from the packet.
 * If that value is negative, then an error has occurred. This can occur if the packet is corrupted or if the audio
 * buffer is too small to hold the decoded audio.
 *
 * Oac is a stateful codec with overlapping blocks and as a result Oac
 * packets are not coded independently of each other. Packets must be
 * passed into the decoder serially and in the correct order for a correct
 * decode. Lost packets can be replaced with loss concealment by calling
 * the decoder with a null pointer and zero length for the missing packet.
 *
 * A single codec state may only be accessed from a single thread at
 * a time and any required locking must be performed by the caller. Separate
 * streams must be decoded with separate decoder states and can be decoded
 * in parallel unless the library was compiled with NONTHREADSAFE_PSEUDOSTACK
 * defined.
 *

 *
 * The repacketizer can be used to merge multiple Oac packets into a single
 * packet or alternatively to split Oac packets that have previously been
 * merged. Splitting valid Oac packets is always guaranteed to succeed,
 * whereas merging valid packets only succeeds if all frames have the same
 * mode, bandwidth, and frame size, and when the total duration of the merged
 * packet is no more than 120 ms. The 120 ms limit comes from the
 * specification and limits decoder memory requirements at a point where
 * framing overhead becomes negligible.
 *
 * The repacketizer currently only operates on elementary Oac
 * streams. It will not manipulate multistream packets successfully, except in
 * the degenerate case where they consist of data from a single stream.
 *
 * The repacketizing process starts with creating a repacketizer state, either
 * by calling oac_repacketizer_create() or by allocating the memory yourself,
 * e.g.,
 * @code
 * OacRepacketizer *rp;
 * rp = (OacRepacketizer*)malloc(oac_repacketizer_get_size());
 * if (rp != NULL)
 *     oac_repacketizer_init(rp);
 * @endcode

 * Then the application should submit packets with oac_repacketizer_cat(),
 * extract new packets with oac_repacketizer_out() or
 * oac_repacketizer_out_range(), and then reset the state for the next set of
 * input packets via oac_repacketizer_init().
 *
 * For example, to split a sequence of packets into individual frames:
 * @code
 * unsigned char *data;
 * int len;
 * while (get_next_packet(&data, &len))
 * {
 *   unsigned char out[1276];
 *   oac_int32 out_len;

 *     output_next_packet(out, out_len);
 *   }
 *   oac_repacketizer_init(rp);
 *   release_packet(data);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Alternatively, to combine a sequence of frames into packets that each
 * contain up to <code>TARGET_DURATION_MS</code> milliseconds of data:
 * @code
 * // The maximum number of packets with duration TARGET_DURATION_MS occurs
 * // when the frame size is 2.5 ms, for a total of (TARGET_DURATION_MS*2/5)
 * // packets.

 *   // guaranteed by the call to oac_packet_get_nb_frames() above, so the

/** @defgroup oac_multistream Oac Multistream API
 * @{
 *
 * The multistream API allows individual Oac streams to be combined into a
 * single packet, enabling support for up to 255 channels. Unlike an
 * elementary Oac stream, the encoder and decoder must negotiate the channel
 * configuration before the decoder can successfully interpret the data in the
 * packets produced by the encoder. Some basic information, such as packet
 * duration, can be computed without any special negotiation.
 *
 * The format for multistream Oac packets is defined in
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7845">RFC 7845</a>
 * and is based on the self-delimited Oac framing described in Appendix B of
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6716">RFC 6716</a>.
 * Normal Oac packets are just a degenerate case of multistream Oac packets,
 * and can be encoded or decoded with the multistream API by setting
 * <code>streams</code> to <code>1</code> when initializing the encoder or
 * decoder.
 *
 * Multistream Oac streams can contain up to 255 elementary Oac streams.
 * These may be either "uncoupled" or "coupled", indicating that the decoder
 * is configured to decode them to either 1 or 2 channels, respectively.
 * The streams are ordered so that all coupled streams appear at the
 * beginning.
 *
 * A <code>mapping</code> table defines which decoded channel <code>i</code>
 * should be used for each input/output (I/O) channel <code>j</code>. This table is
 * typically provided as an unsigned char array.
 * Let <code>i = mapping[j]</code> be the index for I/O channel <code>j</code>.
 * If <code>i < 2*coupled_streams</code>, then I/O channel <code>j</code> is
 * encoded as the left channel of stream <code>(i/2)</code> if <code>i</code>
 * is even, or  as the right channel of stream <code>(i/2)</code> if
 * <code>i</code> is odd. Otherwise, I/O channel <code>j</code> is encoded as
 * mono in stream <code>(i - coupled_streams)</code>, unless it has the special
 * value 255, in which case it is omitted from the encoding entirely (the
 * decoder will reproduce it as silence). Each value <code>i</code> must either
 * be the special value 255 or be less than <code>streams + coupled_streams</code>.
 *
 * The output channels specified by the encoder
 * should use the
 * <a href="https://www.xiph.org/vorbis/doc/Vorbis_I_spec.html#x1-810004.3.9">Vorbis
 * channel ordering</a>. A decoder may wish to apply an additional permutation
 * to the mapping the encoder used to achieve a different output channel
 * order (e.g. for outputting in WAV order).
 *
 * Each multistream packet contains an Oac packet for each stream, and all of
 * the Oac packets in a single multistream packet must have the same
 * duration. Therefore the duration of a multistream packet can be extracted
 * from the TOC sequence of the first stream, which is located at the
 * beginning of the packet, just like an elementary Oac stream:
 *
 * @code
 * int nb_samples;
 * int nb_frames;
 * nb_frames = oac_packet_get_nb_frames(data, len);
 * if (nb_frames < 1)
 *   return nb_frames;
 * nb_samples = oac_packet_get_samples_per_frame(data, 48000) * nb_frames;
 * @endcode
 *
 * The general encoding and decoding process proceeds exactly the same as in
 * the normal @ref oac_encoder and @ref oac_decoder APIs.
 * See their documentation for an overview of how to use the corresponding
 * multistream functions.
